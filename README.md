This repository contains the code for our Computational Humanities Research 2025 paper: **"The Canon in Circulation: Tracking the Reception of Norton Anthology Authors in Library Checkout Data".**

## Paper

This paper explores which canonical American authors the public is reading by analyzing nearly two decades of book circulation data from the Seattle Public Library. We focus on 93 authors from the post-1945 volume of _The Norton Anthology of American Literature_, examining 1.6k works and almost one million checkouts to understand contemporary literary reception.
